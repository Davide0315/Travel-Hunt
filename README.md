This website is part of the Travel Hunt project and represents its front-end implementation.
An initial version of the Homepage and Destination page was generated using Lovable.dev, and has since been significantly customized and extended by the Travel Hunt development team.
The front-end is built with **React + TypeScript**, using **Vite** as the bundler.  
The UI is styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and the project is structured into:

- `components/`: reusable UI components (e.g. cards, header, map)
- `pages/`: main views such as Homepage and Destinations
- `data/`: static content files (e.g. missions and destinations)
- `public/`: assets like images and favicon

Routing is handled with **React Router**.
